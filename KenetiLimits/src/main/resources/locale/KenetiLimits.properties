# Keneti Limits.
# -----------------------------------------------
Info_LimitsManager=The Main command to aid in the management of the plugin.
Info_Registry=The Registry command is to aid in the management of controlled blocks on the server. This applies for Global/World Limits and Paid/Donated protected blocks.
Info_Restrictions=The Restrictions command is to aid in the management of restrictions on the server, namely the config.
Info_BannedItems=A Command to list some of the servers banned items and get information as to why these are banned.\n\n Some items are not listed and may not be available on the server due to the Mod itself not being loaded on the server (not in the Mods Folder).\n\n Items that are banned are to protect the server from various types of issues. If you know of a fix for these bugs and we have not implemented it, you can submit a support ticket on the website, any fix that leads to the unbanning of an item is worth 1,000 credits on the donation store.
Info_LimitedItems=A command to list the Limited Items on the server. Depending on your rank and donation status, you may have limited use of some blocks due to the overpowerdness and or gameplay balance issues with some tekkit based items.
Info_UnlockableItems=A command to list the Unlockable Items on the server. Depending on your rank and donation status, you may have to unlock the use of some blocks to ensure the longevity of the server maps.
